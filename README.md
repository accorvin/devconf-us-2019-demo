# devconf-us-2019-demo

This repository contains the artifacts used during my talk titled
"Handling chaos in containerized environments" at DevConf.us 2019.

Specifically, the contents are the following:

1. A flask application to facilitate demonstration of various scaling
   and stability features of OpenShift

2. Helper scripts, ansible playbooks, and openshift artifact templates
   to be used during each step of the talk.
